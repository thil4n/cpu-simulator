# CPU Simulator

CPU Simulator is a project implemented in TypeScript, designed to simulate the functionality of a CPU. This project aims to help understand the inner workings of a CPU by providing a simulated environment where various CPU operations can be tested and analyzed.

## Features

- Simulate basic CPU operations such as arithmetic, logic, and control instructions.
- Register and memory management.
- Fetch-decode-execute cycle simulation.
- Support for custom instruction sets.
- Visualization of CPU state and operation flow.
