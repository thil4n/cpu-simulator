                CPU Simulator is a web-based tool that lets you visualize how a
                CPU executes assembly instructions. You can load instructions,
                monitor registers, and examine memory in real-time — all from
                your browser. Built with React and Vite, it’s designed to help
                learners and enthusiasts explore computer architecture,
                debugging, and reverse engineering with an interactive
                interface.
